Those who are being nourished among these things are no more able to understand than the thing which lives in the kitchen to smell good. For the teachers accomplished with light and disgraceful speeches so that the body of an orator was weakened and falling. Certainly neither Plato nor Demosthenes agreed with this kind of discipline. </span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="caret-color: rgb(49, 49, 49); font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: normal; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 1px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; color: rgb(49, 49, 49); font-family: -webkit-standard; font-variant-caps: normal;">    Agamemnon did not permit for me to plead any longer: “I admit that teachers sin in this practice, but we ought to forgive them. For unless they have said these things which is pleasing to the young men, as Cicero says, ‘They will be abandoned in schools alone.’ Parents are worthy with blame, who do not want their children to learn strict principles. Now, as boys, are playing in school; as youth, they are being laughed at in the forum.” </span></div></body></html>
