I do not know whether this cause is just; However it is great, and I am seriously angry, because there were no letters from you for a long time. You are able to appease me in only one way, if you have sent me most long letters now at least. This excuse will alone will seem true to me, the rest will seem false. I am not about to hear “I am not in the city” or “I am busy”; nor let the gods allow that I hear “Very sick.” Think about how much care I have for you. I want to know what you make and do. Now send several and most long letters! Goodbye!</div><div><br/></div><div>Letter 2: For a long time I have not taken up a book into my hands, I have not taken up a pencil into my hands; For a long time I do not know what leasure is, what rest is, what that lazy pleasant thing is to do nothing: so many business affairs of my friends are allowing me to neither leave from Rome nor study literature. No pursuits are of such great value that the duty of friendship be neglected. Goodbye! </div></body></html>
