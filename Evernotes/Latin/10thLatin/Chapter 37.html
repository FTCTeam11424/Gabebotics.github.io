Some random man known to me only by his name ran, and with my hand having been snatched, said, “How are you doing?” </div><div><br/></div><div>“Sweetly ,” I said. When that guy was following, I, wanting to go away miserably, at one time I was going quickly, at another I was stopping. That guy was speaking, praising the roads and Rome. As I was never responding to that guy, he said “You want to go away miserably.”</div><div><br/></div><div>“I go to the houses of my certain friends, a long way across the Tiber,” I said.</div><div><br/></div><div>“I have nothing which I am doing, and I am not lazy; I will follow you.” We were coming to the temple Vesta, Now it is after the fourth hour of the day, and he had to respond to his lawsuit; unless he should do this, he would lose his lawsuit. </div><div><br/></div><div>    He said, “If you love me stay here as my support!” </div><div><br/></div><div>    I said, “I should die, if I know legal law” </div><div><br/></div><div>    He said, “What should I do? Should I remain or lawsuit?” </div><div><br/></div><div>    “I.”</div><div>    “Should do nothing”</div><div><br/></div><div>    Then Aristides Fuscus, my caring friend, ran up. I snatched his hands, wavering, eyes twisting this way and that, as he rescued me. </div><div>    “Certainly there is something you want to speak with me,” I said </div><div>    “I remember well, but I am speaking of a bad occasion;Forgive me; it is necessary for me to go.” Then he ran and he abandoned me under a knife. </div><div><br/></div><div>Then he ran to that adversary: “Why do you go away most disgracefully?” Shouted a loud voice, and “Is it allowed for you to come as a witness?” I gave my ears. He snatched that guy into court. Thus Apollo preserve me.</div></body></html>
