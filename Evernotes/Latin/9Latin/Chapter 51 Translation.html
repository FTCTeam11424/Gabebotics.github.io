It was the feast day of Liberalium on which day young Roman men were accustomed to take up the plain white toga. Marcus had completed sixteen years very many months ago; now he was about to takeup the toga of manhood. Therefore Cornelius invited all friends and clients to come to his house on that day. Everyone was knowing that Marcus’ father was very rich; everyone was certain that he would give the best feast to his friends.</div><div>       The home of Gaius Cornelius was full of commotion, loud noise, and shouts. So many and so various men came to that place that the doorkeeper, having advanced from the door, was standing in the doorway itself. If anyone was aproaching, he was asking them with a great voice, who he was and what he wanted. Some were asked to go into the house, he orders others to remain in the road. Some however, who were neither friends nor clients of Cornelius, approached the house, because they were hoping that Cornelius would invite them to dinner. These men were begging this doorkeeper not to send them away; But that man was ordering to leave immediately</div><div>     At last, with all these things having been prepared, Cornelius asked that all of his family come together in the atrium. The neighbors were present; many friends were present; many of the clients were present; All of the slaves and freeman of the Cornelie the present. All were speaking between themselves, all were rejoicing because they had been invited to this toga of manhood ceremony.</div><div>    Marcus was standing in the atrium before the Lararium holding the purple toga and a golden good luck charm in his hands. He noticed that the eyes of everybody were on him. Everyone fell silent. Marcus first deposited the purple toga and the good luck charm before the shrine of the family household gods. “Now” he said, “I lay these boy things down. Now you, O family household gods, I willingly dedicate to you.   <span style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;"> </span></div><div><span style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;">    With this having been done, father ordered a certain slave to put on the toga of Manhood on Marcus. Then the parents embraced him and he was congragulated by the others. Now Marcus, accompanied by many, had been led down into the forum by his father.</span></div><div>    With them having arrived, Marcus having been led to the Tabularius, father asked them who were accompanying him to stay outside the Tabularius. Himself together with his son and a few neighbors entered into the Tabularium, for the name of Marcus had to be registered in the public tablet there</div><div><span>    With these things having been done, All of the bystanders greeted Marcus, already having left, with a great shout. Then when Marcus had thanked everyone because of so much kindness toward him. Everyone had returned to the house of Cornelii for Cornelius had invited many people to dine at his house on this day.  </span><br/></div><div><span style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;">       </span></div></body></html>
