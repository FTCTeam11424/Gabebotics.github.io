Shouted Titus. "How are you?"</div><div>   "Good!" Responded Cornelius. "But I am always, as you can see, busy."</div><div>To this Titus responds, "I am sure you are not about to work tomorrow. All of the Roman citizens will go to the games. I hope that you are also going to the games. </div><div>    To this Cornelius said, "Games? What do you mean, my Titus?" </div><div>"By the gods!" Titus exclaimed. "Tomorrow Caesar is opening his new ampitheater. However, you ask what I am saying?" </div><div>    But Cornelium with a laugh responded, "Surely you notice that I said this as a joke? He will make this day most memorable to everyone. It is agreed that the slaves work strenously and with a very great speed completed it. Martialis will now write a epigram about the sights.

All of the people will attend this ampitheater. Tomorrow morning many people will be on the roads who will come together from all parts to the spectacle. </div><div>    "Therefore!" Said Cornelius. "I think that Aurelia will not go there. You know that Aurelia loves neither the games nor the blood. Aurelia prefers to stay home. I will take Marcus with me however. Now he is a young man and will soon take up the toga of a man for the first time. Sextus however, because he is still a boy, will stay home; for, as Seneca teachers, 'The greater the population, the more danger.' In what hour will you be going to the ampitheater tomorrow?"</div><div>    "At first light" responded Titus, "For I have in mind to to arrive early. When will you and Marcus arrive there?"</div><div>    "Not early," Cornelius said, "but to be sure we will see you in the ampitheater. Now this letter must be finished. Goodbye! </div><div>"Goodbye!" Said Titus. "We who are about to leave salute you!"</div></body></html>
