In the neigboring house a maiden was living named Thisbe. Pyramus, having caught sight of this maiden by chance on the road, he immediately loved her. And Thisbe, when she saw Pyramus, was siezed by love. But alas! Since the parents of both the maiden and the young man were arguing between themelves, they forbid them to meet. It was not even allowed for Thisbe to see Pyramus. Both the maiden and the young man were very much hurting.</div><div>    There was a common wall between both the properties. However there is a crack, which had not been seen by others, was discovered by the lovers. (What does love not notice?) How much they talked between themselves in secret, walking to the river, expressing love. But soon, having given kisses to the wall, they were reluctantly saying goodbye. </div><div>    At last they adopted a new plan. They decided together, with their parents not knowing, to leave the house at night, to meet in the forest, and sit together under a certain tree. And so Thisbe,when she had conceiled her face with a veil, having gone out stealthily she went out towards the woods. When she had come to that place in the woods, she sat underneath that tree. Look! But nonetheless a fierce lion showed up, its mouth splattered wth the blood of a cow. With this thing seen, Thisbe totally frightened fled into a cave, which was nearby. While she fled, she left behind her veil. And this veil the lion stole with his bloody mouth, but soon set it down.</div><div><br/></div><div>Moritura-Future, Active - about to die</div><div>Habitans-Present Active- living</div><div>Expressus-Perfect Passive- having been expressed</div><div>Progressus- Perfect Active-having advanced</div><div><br/></div><div>Thisbe, about to die, loved Pyramus</div><div>Thisbe, dieing, loved pyramus</div><div>Thisbe, having died, does not love Pyramus</div><div><br/></div><div>Adulescens-present active</div><div>Conspectam-perfect passive</div><div>Viso-Perfect passive</div><div>Visa-perfect passive</div><div>Sedentes-Present active</div><div>Exprimentes-Present active</div><div><br/></div><div>Experiens- discovering</div><div> Expertus-having discovered</div><div>Experturus-about to discover</div><div><br/></div></body></html>
