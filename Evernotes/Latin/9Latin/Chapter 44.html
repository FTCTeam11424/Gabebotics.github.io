Suddenly Eucleides asked the boys, "Would you like to go to the baths?"</div><div>    When they had heard these words the boys were rejoicing greatly. Soon they arrived at the baths and went into the changing room which now was full of boys who had left school with their tutors. There they were changing out of their clothes. </div><div>    Marcus, after taking off his clothes, said, "Now let us go out into the exercise room." But Eucleides said, "No!". "Your father ordered me to take you back before the ninth hour." Then another slave, whos name was Asellus, said, "Stay here!". "I will guard the clothes diligently. Here they were accustomed to be many thieves who sell the clothes, having been stolen in the city." </div><div>    Then Asellus reponded, "I always guard the clothes diligently. No one is able to steal the clothes while I guard." Then the boys, since they handed over their clothes, they entered into the warm room and then into the hot room, where there was a great crowd of people. Suddenly, however Sextus exclaimed, "I am sick. I am not able to endure this heat. I will exit and return to the changing room."</div><div>    While leaving the warm room, he caught sight of Asellus sitting near the clothing. Asellus was sleeping. At that time, the clothes were stolen by a certain slave. When Sextus saw this, he exlaimed "Stop thief!". At the same time the thief heard the shout of sextus, Asellus lept out from his chair, and sextus ran towards the door. The thief fled into the exercise room because he thought within his mind to hide in the crowd. When however he was not able to escape on the road, he fled into the cold room.</div><div>    Having seen the thief, Sextus was following him. The thief, with sextus having seen him, now was very afraid. Having slipped on the tiled floor, he fell into the cold water. Immediately Sextus descended into the water. He was trying to drag the thief from the water; but in vain. When however the bystanders helped, the thief thief was extracted from the water, having been captured by Sextus. Sextus brought him, having been captured, to his master</div></body></html>
