Once a major matter was being discussed in the senate and it was carried forward to a later day. It was decided that no one would reveal this matter. The mother of Papirius, the boy who had been with his father in the Curia, asked her son what the father and the senators had discussed. However, The boy responded that it is not allowed to reveal this thing. The women was desiring to hear all the more; The silence of the boy urged her mind so much that she was asking more intensely. </div><div>    </div><div>    Then, with the mother urging, the prudent boy came up with a plan. He said that it had been discussed in the senate whether one man should have two wives or one wife should have two husbands. When she heard this thing, she departed from home in a panic. She carried the thing to the other matrons. </div><div>    </div><div>    The crowd of married women arrived at the senate on the following day. The crying and cursing women begged that one woman have two husbands rather than one husband have two wives. The Senators entering into the Curia were wondering what the matrons wanted. </div><div><br/></div><div>   The boy Papirius having advanced into the middle told what his mother had wanted to hear and what he himself had said to his mom. The senate praised the good faith and intelligence of the boy and made a decree that the boys would not enter with the fathers into Curia afterwards besides that one Papirius. Afterwards the cognomen Praetextatus was given to the boy as an honor because he had displayed so much wisdom.</div></body></html>
