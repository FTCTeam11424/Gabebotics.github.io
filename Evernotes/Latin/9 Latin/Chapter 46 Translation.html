"Why oh no" asked sextus. "Its always raining" responded Marcus. "I had in mind to go down to the campus martius today and to go to the exercise ground but father ordered us to stay at home. I think that father is cruel."</div><div>    At this very time Eucleides entered and asked the boys why they were so sad. "We were desiring to go to the exercise ground." said Marcus, "but father denied this."</div><div>    Eucleides said to him, "Be in good spirit!" He says "I will teach you to play the bandit game. I think that this game is the best. They were playing in this way for approximately two hours. Finally Sextus exlaimed, "This game does not delight me now. I think that this game is the worst. Get up, Marcus! Surely you wish to play odds and evens or morra?"</div><div>     Immediately they both began to shout. Finally Sextus exclaimed, "Five!" Simultaneously Sextus, "Nine!" Then Marcus, "Eight!" Sextus "Six!"</div><div>"Quiet boys!" Interrupted Eucleides. "Don't annoy the mother and Cornelia with your shouts! I think that you are very troublesome today. But the boys were not obeying him. Therefore Cornelia, with the shouts having been heard, having entered into the atrium, asked the boys what they were doing.</div><div>       "Dont annoy us!" Said sextus. "Go away! But why do you have a doll in your hand? Surely not playing with the doll?</div><div>       "You are foolish, Sextus! The doll is not mine. Surely you do not believe i am playing with the doll? This doll, which i myself made, I will give to Davus's daughter as a gift. Today is her birthday." Suddenly Sextus, having snatched the doll away, fled into the peristyle. With this having been seen, Eucleides shouted at Sextus, "Surely you are not harming the doll! return it immediately!" </div><div><span>    At this very moment Cornelius entered. When he had heard what Sextus had done, "Sextus!" he shouted. "Come here!" The boy, now scared, returned into the atrium and returned the doll to Cornelia. Then Cornelius led sextus out of the atrium with him.</span><br/></div><div><span><span>    With this having been done, Marcus asked, "What will father do? What will happen to Sextus? To which Cornelia said, "I think that father has it in mind to beat Sextus." </span><br/></span></div><div><br/></div></body></html>
