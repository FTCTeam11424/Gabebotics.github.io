I journeyed together with my master. When we sailed for four days, suddenly a big storm arose. The ships thrown here and there by the wind, was in great danger. At last when the waves and winds drove the ship to a certain island, we scarcely escaped to land.I stayed the whole night on the shore, at first light, because the force of the storm seemed to have fallen, we returned into the ship.</div><div>     "Suddenly we caught sight of several small ships full of men. The captain of our ship, when he caught sight of the several small ships, exlaimed 'Good heavens! 'Those men are pirates. Oh no! We are not able to escape.'</div><div>     My master said to him, "If you will save me, my father, who is famous and rich, will give a great reward. This ship is faster than those skiffs. The Pirates, even if they follow, will not capture us.'</div><div>     "We tried to escape, but in vain. Indeed the pirates, when they caught us sight of us trying to escape, they attacked our boat. My master immediately took out his sword and shouts to me 'Follow me' and leaped into a small boat.</div><div>     "I Indeed, having followed my master, began to defend my master, for he seemed to have recieved a grave injury. The captain of the ship, because he was very afraid, he forbid his own men to help us. "If we resist the pirates" he said, "without a doubt we will all be killed". </div><div>... Line 30</div><div>   "At night, when everyone was asleep, I rose, and armed with only a dagger. Secretly, I jumped into the sea, swam to shore, and very quickly looked for the house of the pirates. When I started stealthily approaching the house, I saw my master through the window lying in bed and two guards drinking wine. For a short time nothing was happening. Soon however one of the guards went out of the house, another was staying with my master. Then I, having entered in silence, beat the guard with the dagger. Then ,having left the hut,i carried my master to the shore. I found a small ship that the pirates were not guarding. Having set out from the shore, we escaped from the island.</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div></body></html>
