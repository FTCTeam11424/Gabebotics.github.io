Titus Cornelius, as he was accustomed to everyday, having left the home, went down from his house into the Campus Martius to the baths of Nero, together with friends, they were coming together and were talking of the city things as they approached.</div><div>       <span style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;"> When Titus had arrived to that place, after paying his entrance fee, he entered into the entrance. There several of his friends greeted him and they entered together into the changing room. They handed over their taken off clothes to the slaves who were carrying oil and scrapping tools. </span></div><div><span style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;">        Now having been smeared with oil they went out into the exercise room where many citizens were exercising themselves in various ways. Some were throwing the big ball, others were playing trigone, others were wrestling, others were attacking the post with a sword. Titus was playing trigon with two friends. When they had excercised themselves enough in this way, they demanded more oil from the slaves and were rubbed down with the scrapping instruments. Soon the they entered the warm room, then they entered the hot room. Since they were scarcely able to endure the heat and vapor, they did not remain for long. When they returned into to the warm room, they immediately entered into the cold room, and descended into the cold water. Afterward, having been wiped down with a cloth, they put on their clothes again. </span></div><div>    Indeed they did not then depart for home but, after a drink of wine, they began to talk amongst themselves. Everyone was asking Titus, about the affairs of the city since he always seemed to have heard and to have seen the affairs of the city. For they very much wanted to know what is being done in the senate, what had been done by the emperor against the fires, and which famous man is now present in the city.</div><div>       "Nothing new" responded Titus, "but yesterday I saw a ridiculous thing in the Palatin baths. </div></body></html>
