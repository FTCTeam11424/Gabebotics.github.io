The birds were chirping. Nature herself seemed to rejoice. However Cornelia was sitting alone with a sad face in the peristyl. She was thinking to herself: “I am bored of being alone. Why does no one pay attention to me? Why does no one speak to me? Father spends so much time in his study that I never see him. Mother is so busy that she never speaks to me. Marcus and Sextus were so dedicated to their games that they do nothing else. I do not understand why even the slave women neglect me, why talkative Eucleides has said no words to me. Poor me!”</div><div>    Marcus shouted <span style="font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;;">to Cornelia thinking these things</span> “Hey you, Cornelia!” who then entered into the peristyl. “Father orders that you be present in his <span style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;">study immediately. You ought to hurry.”</span></div><div>    Cornelia, when she entered into the study, She saw that mother and father were present, that which was a source of admiration and anxiety to her. Then father with a grave face, “Once upon a time, Cornelia” he said, “Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus, the most famous man of our family, is said to have betrothed his daughter to Tiberius Grachus in the senator’s banquet. After the feast, when Scipio having returned home, had said to his wife that he had betrothed his daughter, she was disturbed with the greatest anger. She said, “It is not fitting for a father to betroth his daughter with the mother unaware.” But your father is not similar to Publius Cornelius for both I and your mother decided together to betroth you to a certain noble young man. Quintus Valerius, that extremely good young man, wants to lead you into marriage, a thing which pleases us. Is it pleasing to you, Cornelia?” </div><div>      Cornelia was so suprised<span style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;"> that she could barely speak, but at last in a small voice, “It pleases me too,” she responded.</span></div><div><span style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;">To which Cornelius said, “Excellent! Tomorrow Valerius himself will be present.”</span></div><div>                                                                                                                                                                    </div></body></html>
