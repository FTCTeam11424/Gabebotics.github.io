And when that lion had seen him far away, suddenly he stood as if wondering and he was then approaching the man slowly and peacefully. Then, moving his tail in a kindly and pleasent manner, he licks the hands of the man with his tongue, now nearly paralyzed with fear. Androcles, with his spirit having now been recovered, watched the lion very attentively.
