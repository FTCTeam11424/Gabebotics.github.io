Therefore Gaius Cornelius began to prepare everyone to go to the Baias. Before they set out, a most sad thing occured. </div><div>                        </div><div>    Cornelius, as he was accustomed, had gone to the baths with his brother Titus. Throughout the whole house there was silence. Suddenly shouts and voices were heard. Cornelius was urging the slaves to carry a bed into the house with the greatest care. Aurelia, with the voices having been heard, bursts into the atrium. “What has been done, Gaius? Why are slaves carrying litter into the house?” To which Cornelius responded, “Our Titus received something bad. The pavement of the frigidarium was so smooth and slippery that he slipped and fell. I believe he fractured his hip. A doctor must be summoned immediately.</div><div><br/></div><div>    Titus was lying down <span style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;">in the litter for many days. At first he was appearing to get better; soon however he was becoming weaker, for he suddenly had fallen into a fever. The sickness was getting worse day by day.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;">   Finally he was so sick that he was barely able to speak. Not much later he passed out of life. Cornelius was affected with the greatest sorrow. The whole house surrendered itself to sadness. Aurelia and Cornelia and all the slave women with their clothes having been cut and their hair having been untied, were. beating their chest. The corpse of titus was placed in the atrium in the funeral pyre. Lanterns and candles were burning around the litter. </span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;">   On the next day the corpse of Titus was carried away with the greatest honor. Pipers, trumpeters, and horn-players were preceeding them. In the procession, there were men </span><span style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;">holding torches, women singing laments, actors bearing the clothes and masks of the ancestors, mimes and attendants carrying bundles of rods, family, and plenty of friends. </span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;">When they had come into the Forum, Gaius Cornelius proceeded in order to appraise his dead brother. He mentioned what type of man Titus had been, how many services he had rendered to the Emperor and the citizens.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;">With this having been done, The corpse of Titus was carried to the tombs of the Flaminia roads in </span><span style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;">the procession. There the funeral pyre had been constructed. The corpse was placed onto the funeral pyre and over the corpse clothes and decorations were placed.
