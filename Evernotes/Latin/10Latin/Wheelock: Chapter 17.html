Juno, whose bad morals Jupiter was barely able to tolerate, held this fact in her memory. After many years she sent death to all who was living on the island Aegina. "O father Jupiter," <span style="-en-paragraph:true;">Aeacus called, </span>"Juno has destroyed my entire population! Help me, your son, whom you love and ought not to neglect. The god heard him and without delay began to change ants into men. Therefore Jupiter for whom nothing is too difficult, he made men and women from small animals. (I say truth or not) The son of Aeaci was Peleus whose son was that Achilles, leader of the Myrmidons.</div></body></html>
