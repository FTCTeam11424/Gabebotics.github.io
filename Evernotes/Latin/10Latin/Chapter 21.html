The boy is being born and a golden family is coming. The world will be liberated from grave fear. That boy will receive the life of the gods and will see the gods, and he himself will be seen by them. He will rule the earth with old virtues. As soon as he will be able to read the praises and deeds of his parent and know virtue, the happy fields will prepare sweet fruits for all men. A few sins will remain, however, who will order the men to surround the cities with walls. There will also be other wars, and therefore great Achilles will be sent to Troy again. When this brave time has made this boy a man, the seas will be abandoned by the seafarers, and sailors will not exchange merchandise for the sake of money. The strong farmer will liberate the bulls from the yoke; The earth will not be touched by the rakes; All of the land will bear everything.</div></body></html>
