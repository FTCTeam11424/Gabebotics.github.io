I will explain to you, o citizens, kinds of men from whom those forces are made up. One kind of them is who <span style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;">in great debt even have big possessions, having been drawn by the love of which they are able to be freed not at all. But I think that these men must not be feared because they are able to be led away from their opinion. </span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;">Another kind is those who, although they are pressed by debt, however they expect power and honor which, with the republic having been disturbed, they think that they are able to take. This thing must be hoped for by these people. For this must be understood by them: First of all that I myself watch over, am here for, and provide for the Republic; Then that good souls are in good men, great harmony of the orders, the greatest multitude of people, the great forces of soldiers; finally that the immortal gods will give help to this undefeated people, to this famous empire</span><span style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;">, and to this beautiful city against so much evil power. Do they hope that  they will be consuls or dictators or even kings in the ashes of the city and in the blood of our citizens.</span></div></body></html>
