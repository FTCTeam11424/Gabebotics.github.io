Behind them he had placed together all of the supplies of the soldiers; Our cavalry, with the river having been crossed, engaged in battle with the cavalry of the enemy. Again and again those guys were retreating into the woods to their own troops and again they were making an attack out of the forest against our men. Our people were daring to follow them only to the edge of the forest. Meanwhile six legions, when they first came, with their weapons having been put down, began to fortify the fort. When the first supplies of our army which were lying hidden were seen by those in the forest, With all the troops flying forward and making an attack against our horseman. With the cavalry having been easily beaten back, they ran to the river with incredible speed. Therefore at one time the enemies were seeming to be both in the woods, in the river, and in our hands. They ran to our camp with the same speed and also to those who had been occupied in labor. </div><div><br/></div><div>Everything had to be done by Caesar at one time. The flag must be raised, the signal must be given by the trumpet, which ordered them to take up weapons; the soldiers must be held back from their work; the battle line must be prepared. The shortness of time and the arrival of the enemy were impeding a great part of these things. Therefore the leaders were not waiting for the command of Caesar because the nearness and quickness of the enemy, but they were doing these things which seemed good by themselves. </div></body></html>
