Therefore she threw the golden apple onto the palace of the immortal gods, on which these letters were written: “The most beautiful.” To whom should the apple be given? Either Juno, Venus, or Minerva? Even Jupiter himself fears to make a decision! Therefore to Paris, son of the king of Troy, those three goddesses came.</div><div><br/></div><div>“O famous young man,” they said, who in your opinion is the most beautiful of us? A great gift will be provided for you by the goddess whom you choose.” Who will Paris choose? Will the mind of the judge be moved by the gift? Juno is able to make him a king, Minerva is able to make him a leader. Venus however is able to give to him Helen, the most beautiful of all women.</div><div><br/></div><div>Paris was defeated by love and gave Venus the golden apple. Therefore (if the report of these deeds are true) Helen, having been captured was led to a new location, Troy. What war was fought over this woman.</div></body></html>
