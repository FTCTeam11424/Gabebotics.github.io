Now, o citizens, since you already hold bad captive leaders of the bad war, you ought to think about your good hope. Catilina was banished out of the middle of the city. He was that man who was feared by everybody, for as long as he was contained by the walls of the city. Now that man who is so keen, so audacious, so watchful in crime, and so diligent in evil things, has been removed. Although all these things were administered by me, o citizens, they seem however to have been administered and provided for by the planning and command of the immortal gods. The immortal gods nourished the hope and faith of this Republic many times. However at this time you all ought to give thanks to them. You all were snatched away from the most cruel and miserable death without slaughter, without blood, without an army. Our affairs will be nourished, o citizens, with your memory; praise fame and glory will be strong; they will live and remain in literature. We are able to be in perpetual peace, oh citizens.Â </div></body></html>
