The eyes of everyone are turned to that man. Then there are many admirations and many praises. The orator touches the mind of the listeners. When he wants them to be moved by fear or pity, having been overwhelmed with fear or pity they are terrified or crying. </div><div>    About the orator, even if you are not sitting and attentively listening but rather you with one look passing by, often you will be able to consider him. You will see the jury yawning with others speaking, sometimes even wandering, sending to the hour(see what time it is), ignoring the words having been spoken by the orator. This case is lacking a true orator, who is able to move the minds of the jury with the speech. However if you have seen the jury standing up straight, who seem to be taught about the situation or will be held in suspense like a bird with some song, you will recognize the signs of a true orator and of an orator who’s doing the orator’s work well.</div></body></html>
