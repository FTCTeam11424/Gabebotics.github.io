When in one day he had been able to make a bridge over Arar and led his army across, <span style="font-weight: bold;">to</span> the Helvetians, who completed the same difficult thing in twenty days, sent ambassadors to him. In such a way, they said, “If the Roman people would make peace with us, in these boundaries <span style="font-weight: bold;">which</span> you want, then we will stay. But if you have it in mind to oppress us with war for a longer time, think about our ancient reputation. For in such a way we learned from our fathers<span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>and our ancestors and we wage war more with might than with ambush. But if you should lead your army against us, then not only would<span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>you lose your salute, but also the honor of the Roman people certainly. </div><div><br/></div><div>     To this Caesar responded in such a way: “Even now if I were able to put down the memory of your earlier faults, then certainly I would not be able to pardon your new evils. Unless you give hostages to us, I will not make peace with you. </div><div><br/></div><div>    The Helvetians, if they had yielded to Caesar, then they would have found better fortune. But arrogantly they responded: “This custom is handed down to us from our ancestors: The Helvetians take hostages, not give them.”    </div></body></html>
