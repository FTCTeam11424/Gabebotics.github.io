    <h1>Chapter 9: NonRenewable Energy<h1>
    <h2>Lesson 9.1 Energy: An Overview<h2>

      <h6>What is Energy?</h6>
Energy is the ability to do work or cause a change <br>
Kinetic Energy: Due to motion <br>
Potential Energy: Due to an object's position or shape <br>

      <h6>Forms of Energy</h6>
Mechanical: Associated with the motion and position of an object; can be kinetic or potential<br>

Electrical: Associated with electric charge; can be kinetic or potential<br>

Thermal: Kinetic energy of atoms and molecules- the faster atoms and molecules move in an object; the warmer it becomes<br>

Electromagnetic: Kinetic energy that travels as waves (Requires MOVING waves)<br>

Chemical: Potential Energy stored in molecular bonds (Example: Food. Allows for us to move and breath.)<br>

Nuclear: Potential energy stored by forces that hold atomic nuclei together (Nuclear Power is breaking apart the Nuclei, causing a conversion to kinetic energy)<br>

      <h6>Energy Conversion and Efficiency</h6>
Energy cannot be destroyed; it can only be converted or changed; from one form to another.<br>

Energy efficiency is an expression of how much of the energy put into a system actually does useful work.<br>

      <h6>Energy Sources and Uses</h6>
      <ul><lh>Energy Sources:</lh> 
    <li>Renewable: Nearly always available or replaceable in a relatively short time; includes sunlight, wind, flowing water, heat from Earth.</li>
    <li>Nonrenewable: Cannot be replaced in a reasonable time; includes fossil fuels and nuclear energy.</li>
      </ul>
<ul><lh>Energy Use:<lh>
  <li>Four uses of energy: Industrial, transportation, residential, commercial.</li>
  <li>Developed nations tend to use more energy than developing nations.</li>
  </ul>
<h2>Lesson 9.2 Fossil Fuels<h2>

            <h6>Fossil Fuels<h6>
* Includes coal, oil, and natural gas<br>
* Formed from the remains of organisms millions of years ago<br>

              <h6>Coal</h6>
* Formed from plant remains subjected to high heat and pressures over millions of years(The older the coal is the more dense it becomes.)<br>
* Provides 1/4 of the world's energy<br>
* Compared to other fossil fuels, coal is cheap, needs little processing, and is easy to transport<br>
* We use coal for a quarter of the worlds energy. (Thats a lot. The US has the most coal deposits in the world.)<br>

              <h6>Coal Mining</h6>
* Strip Mining: Overlying rock and soil are removed to access coal (safer for miners.) (Requires Shallow deposits of coal. Tends to be a cheaper method, however extremely disruptive to environment.)<br>
* Subsurface mining: Underground shafts are dug to access coal under Earth's surface. (VERY dangerous for miners. Less harmful for environment though.)<br>
* Obama administration closed most coal mines in the US, while the Trump administration opened them all again, and looked into making more mines.<br>
* Mountain top removal: blowing up the top of a mountain and removing large strips of dirt to mine for coal<br>

            <h6>Oil</h6>
* Dark, liquid fossil fuel made up mostly of hydrocarbons<br>
* Formed from the remains of ancient marine organisms and found in underground deposits<br>
* Used in fuel for cars, trucks, planes, ships<br>
* Used in chemical compounds (Petrochemicals)<br>
* Also known as petroleum<br>

            <h6>Drilling and refining Oil</h6>
* When oil is extracted from the ground it is called crude oil<br>
* After crude oil is extracted, it is seperated into different fuels in a refinery.<br> 
* Primary extraction: Oil flows out of the well, because it is already under pressure.<br>
* Secondary extraction: Increased pressure or injections needed to remove oil.<br>

            <h6>Natural Gas</h6>
* Primarily methane gas with small amounts of other gases mixed in
* Often found above oil or coal deposits
* Much less polluting than coal or oil and releases more energy when combusted
* Used for heating, appliances (stoves, dryers), and making electricity
* Natural Gas is very difficult to find, very hard to use, and very hard to contain.
* Natural Gas is used to heat homes and to cook.
            
            Fossil Fuel Supply
* Consumption is still rising, but new fossil fuels do not form on a human timescale.
* New oil sources-oil sands, oil shale, methane hydrates- are expensive, energy-intensive, and can be hard to obtain.
* Coal sources are still relatively abundant, but not infinite.
* We are running out of fossil fuels. Sometime within 100-200 years we will run out if we maintain this consumption rate.

Lesson 9.3 Consequences of Fossil Fuel Use

            Pollution, Climate Change, and Public Health
* Burning Fossil Fuels releases carbon dioxide, which contributes to global climate change.
* When coal and oil burn, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides are released, which contribute to smog and acid deposition.
* Oil spills, equipment ruptures, and oil in runoff pollute waterways, oceans, and coastal areas. 
* Coal-fired power plants release mercyrym which harms human health. Crude oil contains trade amounts of lead and arsenic. (Most of mercury in atmosphere is due to coal power plants.)

            Gulf of Mexico Oil Well Explosions
1979: Ixtoc I exploratory oil well
* 50m below surface
* Released 126 million gal oil; containment efforts took 9 months
* What didn't work: cap, iphoning, controlled burn, "top kill"
* What did work: Relief wells

2010: Deepwater Horizon oil well
* 1500m below surfae
* Largest U.S. offshore oil breach as of 2010- 21.2-33.55 million gal of oil released during first 6 weeks, based on USGS rough estimates
* Hundreds of miles of coastal habitats threatened
* Methods tried: dome, cap, siphoning, controlled burns, "top kill", "junk shot", and relief wells

            Damaging Caused by Extracting Fuels
Mining:
* Humans risk lives and respiratory health
* Ecosystems are damaged by habitat destruction, extensive erosion, acid drainage, and heavy metal contamination downslope of mines

Oil and gas extraction: 
* Roads and structures built to support drilling break up habitats and harm ecosystems.
* The longterm consequences of accidents can be uncertain or unpredictable.

            Dependence on Foreign Sources
* Fossil fuels are not evenly distributed over the globe, so some countries must import fuel sources.
* Nations that import fuel may be vulnerable to changes in fuel prices set by suppliers
* Nations can import less fuel by developing domestic oil sources and renewable energy sources.

            Energy Conservation
* Practice of reducing energy use to make fossil fuels last and to prevent environmental damage.
* Transportation: Gas-efficient cars and higher gas prices could help conserve energy in the U.S.
* Personal choices: Individuals can save energy by turning off lights, taking public transit, and buying energy-efficient appliances.

Lesson 9.4 Nuclear Power
            Nuclear Fission
* Splits an atomic nucleas into two smaller nuclei. 
* Releases neutrons and large amounts of energy, if enough unstable nuclei are present, a nuclear chain reaction can occur.
* A Neutron is fired at a uranium 235 nucleas, splits and leaves 3 waste nuclei, allowing more nuclear power to be created.

            Generating Electricity Using Nuclear Energy
* Uranium undergoing Nuclear Fission, producing heat.
* Water is heated and creates steam, which spins a turbine
* This then generates electricity.
* The steam is then cooled to become water again
* The process repeats

            Benefits and Costs of Nuclear Power
* Benefits:
    * No air pollution (Less harmful for environment)
    * Requires little uranium fuel and little mining
    * Under normal condition, nuclear power plants are safer for workers than coal burning power plants.
* Costs:
    * Expensive to build and mantain
    * Catastrophic accidents are possible
    * Nuclear waste must be stored for thousands of years 

            Nuclear Waste
* Waste is currently held at power plants as a stopgap, but a long-term storage location is needed.
* Long-term storage sites must be distant from population centers, protected from sabotage, have a deep water table, and be geologically stable.
* Yucca Mountain, Nevada, was chosen by the U.S. government in the 1980s, and a storage site was constructed there. But, as of 2010, the Yucca Mountain project is no longer under development.

            Nuclear Fusion
* Joining two atomic nuclei to form one nucleus
* Releases much more energy than fission
* Currently impractical because very high temperatures are needed, but scientists continue exploring fusion for our future energy needs.

            Nuclear Fission/Fusion
* Nuclear Fission:
    * Uranium nucleus is splitted into energy and two other waste nuclei.
* Nuclear Fusion: 
    * Combining two hydrogen nuclei into a Helium nucleus.
    * Requires energy
    * Produces a TON of energy.
    * No waste</p>
